As of 7.4.2016 the nodes do not yet affect each other. When I figure out the math, I will implement this. My plan is to figure out some kind of energy system for the nodes so that when a node affects some other node, the other node loses energy, which is then done over and over again until a node does not have enough energy to affect any more nodes.
