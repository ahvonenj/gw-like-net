# gw-like-net

As of 7.4.2016 the nodes do not yet affect each other. When I figure out the math, I will implement this. My plan is to figure out some kind of energy system for the nodes so that when a node affects some other node, the other node loses energy, which is then done over and over again until some nth-node does not have enough energy to affect any more nodes.

As of 9.4.2016 the net and the nodes now span, relax and deccelerate; eventually reaching a point where they become static again.
